<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Introduction to the Field
This part serves as a comprehensive introduction to the interdiciplinary field of EEG-AI, where the boundaries of neuroscience, computer science, and machine learning converge.

### What is Electroencephalography(EEG)?

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique used to measure electrical activity in the brain. This method involves placing electrodes on the scalp, which detect tiny electrical signals produced by neurons firing in the brain. These signals are recorded as waveforms, which can be analyzed to understand brain function.
Neurons communicate through electrical impulses, and the collective activity of neurons generates electric fields that can be detected on the scalp.
EEG measures these electric fields, typically in the range of microvolts (µV).
The recorded signals are displayed as a series of waveforms, representing different frequencies and amplitudes of brain activity.

#### Why is EEG Data so Compelling?
1. EEG captures cognitive dynamics in the time frame in which cognition occurs.
    1. Cognitive, perceptual, linguistic, emotional, and motor processes are fast and most of them occur within tens to hundreds of milliseconds. 
    2. Furthermore, cognitive events occur in a temporal sequence that may span hundreds of milliseconds to a few seconds. This means EEG which is a high temporal-resolution technique is well suited to capture these fast, dynamic, and temporally sequenced cognitive events.
    3. As an example the temporal precision of the hemodynamic response which is captured by fMRI  is 2 – 3 orders of magnitude slower than that of the electrophysiological response.
2. Neural Data is valuable and contains a wealth of information within.
   1. Neural oscillations offer a window into the intricate workings of the human brain, providing valuable insights into cognition, behavior, and neural function.
   2. Oscillations that can be observed in the EEG signal are direct reflections of neural oscillations in the cortex. 
   3. The neurophysiological mechanisms that give rise to population-level oscillations are well understood and can be modeled fairly accurately.
4. EEG signal is multidimensional. 
    1. The multidimensionality of EEG data allows for analyses that are inspired by known physiological mechanisms. This offers the opportunity to link findings obtained through noninvasive recordings in humans to invasive recordings in nonhuman animals as well as to biophysical models of neural ensemble activity.
    2. EEG data comprise at least four dimensions: time, space, frequency, and power and phase.
        - Time series: The EEG signal is recorded over a period of time (usually several seconds or minutes), resulting in a time series of voltage values.
        - Frequency bands: EEG signals can be divided into different frequency bands, such as:
            - Delta (0.5-4 Hz): associated with sleep, relaxation, and unconsciousness
            - Theta (4-8 Hz): associated with drowsiness, meditation, and unconsciousness
            - Alpha (8-12 Hz): associated with relaxation, closed eyes, and decreased cortical activity
            - Beta (13-30 Hz): associated with attention, cognitive processing, and motor activity
            - Gamma (30-100 Hz): associated with higher-level cognitive processing, attention, and working memory
        - Electrode locations: EEG signals are recorded from multiple electrodes placed on the scalp or brain surface. spacial locations
        - Power and Phase: Power is the strength of frequency-band-specific activity and phase id the timing of it.
          - They are discrete elements of a dimension because they provide largely independent information.
          - For example, two brain regions might show similar power in the theta band but have different phases. This could indicate that they are involved in different cognitive processes, even though they are both active in the same frequency range.
