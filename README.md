<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This meticulously curated list aims to showcase the latest breakthroughs in the fusion of Electroencephalography (EEG) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). By consolidating related fields and subfields, we've created a user-friendly framework that allows you to quickly explore them.

Whether you're a researcher, student, or hobbyist, this guide is designed to serve as a valuable resource for your endeavors. We hope you find it informative, inspiring, and useful in exploring the vast potential of EEG-AI applications.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Introduction to the Field
This part serves as a comprehensive introduction to the interdiciplinary field of EEG-AI, where the boundaries of neuroscience, computer science, and machine learning converge.

### What is Electroencephalography(EEG)?

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique used to measure electrical activity in the brain. This method involves placing electrodes on the scalp, which detect tiny electrical signals produced by neurons firing in the brain. These signals are recorded as waveforms, which can be analyzed to understand brain function.
Neurons communicate through electrical impulses, and the collective activity of neurons generates electric fields that can be detected on the scalp.
EEG measures these electric fields, typically in the range of microvolts (ÂµV).
The recorded signals are displayed as a series of waveforms, representing different frequencies and amplitudes of brain activity.

### Why is EEG Data so Compelling?
1. EEG captures cognitive dynamics in the time frame in which cognition occurs.
    1. Cognitive, perceptual, linguistic, emotional, and motor processes are fast and most of them occur within tens to hundreds of milliseconds. 
    2. Furthermore, cognitive events occur in a temporal sequence that may span hundreds of milliseconds to a few seconds. This means EEG which is a high temporal-resolution technique is well suited to capture these fast, dynamic, and temporally sequenced cognitive events.
    3. As an example the temporal precision of the hemodynamic response which is captured by fMRI  is 2 â€“ 3 orders of magnitude slower than that of the electrophysiological response.
2. Neural Data is valuable and contains a wealth of information within.
   1. Neural oscillations offer a window into the intricate workings of the human brain, providing valuable insights into cognition, behavior, and neural function.
   2. Oscillations that can be observed in the EEG signal are direct reflections of neural oscillations in the cortex. 
   3. The neurophysiological mechanisms that give rise to population-level oscillations are well understood and can be modeled fairly accurately.
4. EEG signal is multidimensional. 
    1. The multidimensionality of EEG data allows for analyses that are inspired by known physiological mechanisms. This offers the opportunity to link findings obtained through noninvasive recordings in humans to invasive recordings in nonhuman animals as well as to biophysical models of neural ensemble activity.
    2. EEG data comprise at least four dimensions: time, space, frequency, and power and phase.
        - Time series: The EEG signal is recorded over a period of time (usually several seconds or minutes), resulting in a time series of voltage values.
        - Frequency bands: EEG signals can be divided into different frequency bands, such as:
            - Delta (0.5-4 Hz): associated with sleep, relaxation, and unconsciousness
            - Theta (4-8 Hz): associated with drowsiness, meditation, and unconsciousness
            - Alpha (8-12 Hz): associated with relaxation, closed eyes, and decreased cortical activity
            - Beta (13-30 Hz): associated with attention, cognitive processing, and motor activity
            - Gamma (30-100 Hz): associated with higher-level cognitive processing, attention, and working memory
        - Electrode locations: EEG signals are recorded from multiple electrodes placed on the scalp or brain surface. spacial locations
        - Power and Phase: Power is the strength of frequency-band-specific activity and phase id the timing of it.
          - They are discrete elements of a dimension because they provide largely independent information.
          - For example, two brain regions might show similar power in the theta band but have different phases. This could indicate that they are involved in different cognitive processes, even though they are both active in the same frequency range.

### What Are the Applications of EEG-AI in Various Fields?   
Signal processing and machine learning techniques are crucial for accurately interpreting EEG data, which is challenging due to its non-stationary nature, inter-subject variability, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In recent years, deep neural networks have been increasingly employed to address these challenges, often outperforming traditional EEG analysis methods. Here are some of the broad fields where EEG-AI is utilized:
1. **Neurological Disorder Diagnosis and Monitoring:** Using EEG data to detect and monitor conditions like epilepsy, Alzheimer's, and other neurological disorders.
2. **Medical Procedures and Interventions:** Assisting in procedures such as brain surgery and neurofeedback therapy by providing real-time brain activity monitoring.
3. **Cognitive and Performance Assessment:** Evaluating cognitive functions and mental workload in educational, professional, and clinical settings.
4. **Assistive Technologies and Rehabilitation:** Developing devices and therapies for individuals with disabilities, including communication aids and mobility support.
5. **Neuroscientific Research:** Studying brain function and neural mechanisms underlying various behaviors and cognitive processes.
6. **Education and Sports:** Enhancing learning experiences and athletic performance through brain-computer interfaces and neurofeedback.
7. **Consumer Applications:** Creating products like neurofeedback games, meditation aids, and devices for mental wellness and stress management.
8. **Marketing and Consumer Behavior:** Analyzing consumer responses and decision-making processes to optimize advertising and product design.
9. **Military and Security:** Applications in monitoring alertness, cognitive load, and stress in high-risk situations, and enhancing training and performance.

  <summary>Dementia</summary>
  Dementia has been defined as a deterioration in cognitive capacities which impairs an individualâ€™s capacity to carry out tasks independently daily. It is critical to recognize that dementia is more accurately defined as a syndrome than as a single disease. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a nonintrusive neural imaging approach, which tracks the brainâ€™s electrical activities. EEG signals have shown notable alterations in dementia patients, making EEG a helpful tool for early-stage dementia recognition and diagnosis. Machine learning algorithms have shown potential in detecting patterns in EEG data that correspond to different stages of dementia. This allows the creation of a unique dementia diagnostic tool that outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy and cost-effectiveness. However, further research is needed to evaluate these algorithms in clinical settings. The research dives into the implementation of multiple machine-learning methods, the extraction of attributes from EEG data, and the evaluation of these algorithmsâ€™ performance.

  <summary>Epilepsy and Seizure</summary>
  Epilepsy is a central nervous system disorder. In epilepsy brain activity becomes abnormal, leading to times of abnormal behavior or seizures, and at times loss of awareness. Consequently, epilepsy patients face problems in daily life due to precautions they must take to adapt to this condition, particularly when they use heavy equipment, e.g., vehicle derivation. Epilepsy studies rely primarily on electroencephalography (EEG) signals to evaluate brain activity during seizures. It is troublesome and time-consuming to manually decide the location of seizures in EEG signals.

  <summary>Traumatic Brain Injury</summary>
  Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can produce temporary biochemical imbalance due to leaks through cell membranes or disruption of the axoplasmic flow due to the misalignment of intracellular neurofilaments. If untreated, TBI can lead to Alzheimerâ€™s, Parkinsonâ€™s, or total disability. Mild TBI (mTBI) accounts for about about 90 percent of all TBI cases. The detection of TBI as soon as it happens is crucial for successful treatment management. Neuroimaging-based tests provide only a structural and functional mapping of the brain with poor temporal resolution. Such tests may not detect mTBI. On the other hand, the electroencephalogram (EEG) provides good spatial resolution and excellent temporal resolution of the brain activities beside its portability and low cost.

  **Proprioceptive (body awareness):**
The proprioceptive system is located in our muscles and joints. It provides us with a sense of body awareness and detects/controls force and pressure. The proprioceptive system also has an important regulatory role in sensory processing as proprioceptive input can assist in controlling responses to sensory stimuli.

Proprioceptive input can be very calming for those who are easily overwhelmed by sensory stimulation.

Proprioceptive input can be alerting for those who need increased sensory stimulation to facilitate attention and learning.

Many students with autism seek proprioceptive input in order to regulate their emotional and behavioural responses to sensory stimulation.

  <summary>Neuroergonomics</summary>
  Researchers in the field of human factors and ergonomics examine both physical and cognitive human abilities and limitations and use this information to design safer, more convenient, and efficient work environments for people to interact with (Dehais and Ayaz, 2019). Neuroergonomics, which was developed as a special field of ergonomics, combines neuroscience and ergonomics to examine the brain and mental behavior of people working in the business environment (Parasuraman, 2003). It is used for the design and evaluation of humanâ€“machine systems in various work environments through the mental examination or modeling of workers (Parasuraman, 2003, Parasuraman and Rizzo, 2009). Neuroergonomics includes studies of the brain and behaviors at work and explores the relationship between work-related tasks and the brain to modify work environments to increase performance (James, 2012).

Within the scope of neuroergonomics, one of the primary studies carried out to understand how a task has an effect on a working person is to determine the mental workload. Mental workload is the cognitive demand of a task. Mental workload may be evaluated by recording psychophysiological components (cardiac activity, electrooculogram, respiration or event-related potentials of brain activity signals), task performance (commonly measured with response accuracy and response latency), and self-rating questionnaires [mostly used ones being the NASA-Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) (Hart and Staveland, 1988) and the subjective workload assessment technique (SWAT) (Reid and Nygren, 1988)]. Both the task-related components and subject-related characteristics can be the reason for the increase in mental workload (Galy et al., 2012). In everyday life, increasing mental workload causes overload and eventually decreases the task performance (Borghini et al., 2014).
